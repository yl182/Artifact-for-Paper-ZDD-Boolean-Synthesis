CNFtoZDDconverter.cpp: 
	given a QDIMACS file path, draw .dot and .png of ZDD

resolution part (realizability set):
	zdd_myunion, zdd_myproduct (useful for resolution) are defined in QMRes/manip.h
	we have included and re-wrapped them in cuddObj.c (.h)'s ZDD class:
		1) SubSumptionFreeUnion
		2) ClauseDistribution
	(cuddObj.c has ZDD class)
	in our part, we extract f_y^-, f_y^+, f_y' and call wrapper functions in cuddObj.c to operate resolution
	【there are some bugs in the way of calling QMRes functions】
	【since the helper functions are distributed in many QMRes files】
	zdd_myunion( zdd_myproduct(z(f_x^+), z(f_x^-)), z(f_x'))
	problem: QMRes' manip.c calls a lot of functions that I don't know they are defined

	have used QMRes functions to do resolution and generate the ZDD for realizability set

	manage QMRes
	witness construction
	full realizability
	portfolio 
	lucas has some naive way of constructing BDD clause by clause
	would be interesting to take planner for DPMC
	synthesis comparison there
	logarithmic

	first have end-to-end, given a formula, have witnesses
