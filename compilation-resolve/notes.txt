CNFtoZDDconverter.cpp: 
	given a QDIMACS file path, draw .dot and .png of ZDD

resolution part (realizability set):
	zdd_myunion, zdd_myproduct (useful for resolution) are defined in QMRes/manip.h
	we have included and re-wrapped them in cuddObj.c (.h)'s ZDD class:
		1) SubSumptionFreeUnion
		2) ClauseDistribution
	(cuddObj.c has ZDD class)
	in our part, we extract f_y^-, f_y^+, f_y' and call wrapper functions in cuddObj.c to operate resolution
	there are some bugs in the way of calling QMRes functions
	zdd_myunion( zdd_myproduct(z(f_x^+), z(f_x^-)), z(f_x'))
	problem: QMRes' manip.c calls a lot of functions that I don't know they are defined
